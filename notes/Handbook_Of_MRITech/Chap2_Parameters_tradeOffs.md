Parameters and Trade-offs 

Main considerations for Image quality are 

signal to noise ratio (SNR)
contrast to noise ratio (cnr)

spatial resolution

Scan Time 


SNR is usually increased by using 

- spin echo (SE) and fast spin echo (FSE) pulse sequences
- a long repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE)
- a flip angle of 90Â°
- a well-tuned and correctly sized coil
- a coarse matrix


CNR 
Contrast to noise ratio

The contrast to noise ratio (CNR) is defined as the difference in the SNR
between two adjacent areas.

- Administration of contrast agents.
- Utilization of T2 weighted sequences.
- Selection of magnetization transfer (MT) sequences.
- Suppression of normal tissues via chemical/spectral presaturation,
or sequences that null signal from certain tissues: short TI inversion
recovery (STIR), fluid alternated inversion recovery (FLAIR),
magnetization-prepared sequences).
