Parameters and Trade-offs 

Main considerations for Image quality are 

signal to noise ratio (SNR)
contrast to noise ratio (cnr)

spatial resolution

Scan Time 


SNR is usually increased by using 

- spin echo (SE) and fast spin echo (FSE) pulse sequences
- a long repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE)
- a flip angle of 90Â°
- a well-tuned and correctly sized coil
- a coarse matrix
