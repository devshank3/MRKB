### Book Guidelines - Summary 

The "MRI Handbook" is designed to guide readers through common MRI examinations, offering a structured explanation of procedures. The book is split into two parts.

- Part 1 provides concise summaries of essential MRI concepts, such as parameters, pulse sequences, artifacts, gating techniques, patient safety, and contrast agents. These are not exhaustive but serve as a foundational overview, with further reading suggested in more comprehensive MRI physics texts like "MRI in Practice."

- Part 2 focuses on specific MRI examinations, categorized by anatomical regions: head and neck, spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis, upper limb, lower limb, and pediatric imaging. Each section details basic anatomy, common reasons for scanning, necessary equipment, patient positioning, suggested protocols, and tips for image optimization. Simple anatomical diagrams and common indications for scanning each area are included to assist understanding.

### Equipment 

The equipment section of the "MRI Handbook" details the necessary tools for MRI examinations, focusing on the types of coils used and their roles in improving image quality. It covers:  
   
- **Volume Coils**: These transceivers both transmit and receive RF signals, improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by using quadrature technology. They cover large anatomical areas with uniform signal distribution.  
   
- **Phased Array Coils**: These combine multiple coils and receivers to provide the benefits of both small coils (better SNR) and volume coils (greater coverage). They are particularly useful for spinal and breast imaging.  
   
- **Surface/Local Coils**: Designed for structures near the skin, these coils enhance SNR by being placed close to the area of interest. They primarily receive signals while RF is transmitted by the body coil.  
   
- **Parallel Imaging Coils**: Utilizing multiple coils or channels, these decrease scan time or increase resolution by dividing the data acquisition across several coils. They require additional hardware and software and are useful in brain and body imaging.  

Difference 
| **Coil Type**       | **Functionality**                           | **Advantages**                                                 | **Typical Uses**                  |  
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|  
| **Volume Coils**    | Transmit and receive RF signals (transceivers), usually quadrature | Covers large areas, uniform signal across FOV, improved SNR     | General body imaging              |  
| **Phased Array Coils** | Multiple coils and receivers combine signals | Combines benefits of small and large coils, improved SNR and coverage | Spinal imaging, breast imaging    |  
| **Surface/Local Coils** | Receive signals, RF transmitted by body coil | Improved SNR near skin, customized fit for specific areas       | Imaging near skin surface         |  
| **Parallel Imaging Coils** | Multiple coils/channels for data acquisition | Decreases scan time, increases resolution, software removes aliasing | Brain and body imaging            |  

Coil selection is crucial for achieving optimal image quality. Key practices include ensuring cable integrity, correct connection, proper coil orientation towards the patient, proximity to the examination area, and stability during scanning. The receiving surface should be parallel to the magnet's Z-axis to maximize signal capture. Proper coil use directly affects the resultant SNR and overall image quality.

### Patient positioning 

The section on patient positioning outlines the correct placement and immobilization techniques for MRI examinations, using a laser light system for alignment. The longitudinal, horizontal, and vertical alignment lights help position patients relative to the magnet's bore. Typically, patients are placed head first for scans of the head, neck, spine, chest, upper abdomen, shoulders, and upper limbs. For the pelvis, hips, and lower limbs, patients are positioned feet first in the magnet.

### Suggested Protocol

- Provides general guidelines for MRI procedures.  
- Acknowledges that protocols vary by facility and radiologist preference.  
- Useful for practitioners without a radiologist or dealing with rare examinations.  
- Focuses on scan plane, weighting, pulse sequence choices, and slice positioning.  
- Based on authors' practice, not definitive rules.  
- Encourages adaptation to specific needs.  
- Includes explicit slice prescription coordinates (in mm) for localizers.  
- Coordinates depend on patient positioning and region of interest.  
- Avoids repetition by referencing existing protocols with adaptations.  
- Suggests additional sequences for some exams.  
- Recognizes that 'routine' sequences can vary among practitioners.
